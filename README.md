# HOB-net:High-order Block Network via Deep Metric Learning for Person Re-identification  

Implementation of the paper HOB-net:High-order Block Network via Deep Metric Learning for Person Re-identification.  
  
The approach proposed in the paper is simple yet effective on three re-ID datasets: Market-1501, DukdMTMC-ReID and CUHK03.
